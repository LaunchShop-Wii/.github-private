# LaunchShop Organization

*This is a private repository that is used by LaunchShop admins. If you are an admin, feel free to edit a repository if there's a bug or a problem in there.*

## Here's what you can do:
 1. **Swear.** This is a private organization anyway. If you are angry, you must be a little hungry! Just kidding, if you are tired of a error in a code just make a issue or do a commit and swear all you want on the description.
 2. **Share test code.** Made something (for LaunchShop) and not sure if it works? Ping staff and give them a link to repo, and let them try it. ***ALL OF THIS SHOULD BE TESTED ON A VIRTUAL MACHINE.***
 3. **Collaborate.** It's more fun that way!
 4. **Send prototypes.** Archive old versions here, even the ones that should not be seen here.

 Test WADs and homebrew apps on a EmuNAND as well or use your **real NAND on Dolphin**.
